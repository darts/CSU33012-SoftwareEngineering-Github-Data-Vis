# 'Advanced' Github Access

The code in this repo aims to provide more functionality to the user by providing insights into data gathered from a user.  
Things I plan to implement:
- ability to also look at repos
- ~~some ability to function without an access token~~
- more graphs
  - eg language data with breakdowns by repo
  - clearer ribbon graph for commit times
  - better commit time view (another graph?)
  - graph of user and followers (not sure the correct term, bubble graph maybe?)
  - a 3d bar chart comparing commit comment length to time
