# 'Advanced' Github Access

The code in this repo aims to provide more functionality to the user by providing insights into data gathered from a user.  
Things I plan to implement:
- ability to also look at repos
- ~~some ability to function without an access token~~
- more graphs
  - ~~eg language data with breakdowns by repo~~
  - ~~clearer ribbon graph for commit times~~
  - ~~better commit time view (another graph?)~~
  - line graph should be rainbow colours
  - commits by day ribbon graph needs to support days with no commits
  - graph of user and followers (not sure the correct term, bubble graph maybe?)
  - ~~a 3d bar chart comparing commit comment length to time~~ replaced with a 2d bar chart of additions vs deletions
  - ~~fix repos not showing in churn thing (eg matthew's sweng visual)~~
